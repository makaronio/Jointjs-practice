Diagrams consist of elements connected with links. A diagram in JointJS is represented by a model joint.dia.Graph.
This model then collects cells (a term representing both elements and links).
A cell could therefore be either an element (joint.dia.Element or its inheritants) or
a link (joint.dia.Link). In JointJS (starting from version 0.6), you manipulate models, not views.
